               <h5>Year I<h5>
                 <p> Our first four weeks were devoted to coming to grips with both the field of Web development and its core technologies. Firstly, we learnt introduction to core browser programming and setting up our development environment in both first and second weeks. We also learnt how to install and use Git, the shell/ command line, Browsersync and the Atom text editor.
                 After that we learnt introduction to HTML and CSS in third week. This week we began our first project with a simple structural exercise and the basic syntax for HTML and CSS.
                 Further we started with the 'Ottergram' project in fourth week and covered advanced CSS by using the display and positioning properties, also the use of 'Flexbox' property.
                 We introduced 'positioning' concepts in CSS by using two different approaches to style the layout of our page in fifth week.
             <p><br>Similarly, from six to ten weeks we learnt how to implement Media Queries so that our project can be viewed on a range of devices. We also began to look at the basics of creating behaviors or interactions in the browser by writing some simple JavaScript. In the last week we focused on User Interface Design using Google's Material Design styleguide.</p>
                 In sixth week we focused on designing an adaptive interface.
                 A continuation of animation using CSS3 and further work on aspects of visual communication with Google's Material Design was done in seventh and eighth weeks.
                 Further more we dealed with an introduction to Googles Material Design and then finished up the Ottergram project in nineth and tenth week.
                 In the final week we covered use of typography (webfonts), transitions and transformations, testing, debugging and validating forms, colour, using icons/ icon fonts, accessibility and optimising images.</P>
